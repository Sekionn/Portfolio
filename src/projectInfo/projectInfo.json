    "Again": "Developed by 7 students from Vallekilde HÃ¸jskole gamedevelopment course, during Nordic Game Jam 2019.\n\nThe game follows our hero who ventures into a cave, only to find that each room leads to another that looks exactly the same. The rooms look the same, however, the way to traverse them is never the same.\n\nChristian Bodeval, Emil Hoeffner, Sebastian Juul, Simon Konradsen, Jeppe Munk, Rosa Friholm & Erik Rejnols.",
