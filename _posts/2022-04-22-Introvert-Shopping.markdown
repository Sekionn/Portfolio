This Game is about an introvert going out shopping.

This normally wouldn't be a problem.

But people in this world are extra extroverted so they tend to try and talk to anyone to the point where they start to chase you if you don't answer them.

For this game there is just one goal, to get every item on your shopping list without interacting with anyone!



The game is only in danish and a school project, created by three students.
